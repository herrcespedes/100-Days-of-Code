#### Chapter 6: Strings

> A **String** is a sequence of characters

strings are similar to arrays, can be indexed, 

```python
fruit = 'banana'
letter = fruit[1]
print(letter)
>>>a
```

| Operator | Description       |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| [ ]      | indexing operator |
| +        | concatenation     |

- if we index beyond the size of the word, we will raise an error

### Slicing Strings

```python
s = 'Monty Python'
print(s[0:4])
>>> Mont
```

slicing is like indexing but specifying a range thru the beginning and end.

[a:b] where a = beginnign and b is ending

[ :b] this is index from the beginning thru b

[a: ] this is index from a to the end



to find out all the methods >>>dir(str)
